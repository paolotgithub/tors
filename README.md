# tors

# tors_interactor_finder is a small, simple and stupid Python 3 app to search interactions starting from a seed list and an interaction dataset.
# Its original use is intended in network biology and network medicine, but of course it can be used to dig into any type of interaction dataset.
# It searches for seed genes interactors and interactions, and generates a report with interaction data to be used for further network analysis.
# It can easily be used by typing on the terminal the following instructions:

python tors_interaction_finder_p3_ok.py

# and following the few further instructions on screen.
